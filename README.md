#Team of Legends

## Developer: Adrian Nuyda

###Description:

I'll be building an application relating to League of Legends which will help players to find other local players who either want to create a competitive team to play against other local teams or teams via online on the rift. <b>The goal of this app is to build a community of League of Legends players to come together to form local teams, talk about League of Legends, or anything relating to eSports or whatever they desire.</b>

Users will create an account and will have to provide some important information such as their name, location, language, position, skill level, DOB, type of transportation, and in-game screen name. From there, users will have the ability to browse other users' information and can also create a team to play competitevely, <i>(or casually)</i>, against other local teams or online. After creating a team, the user who is managing the team can find other users and will be able to select/invite someone into their team, while users without a team will be able to browse other teams that are in need of players.

If there is time, I would like to implement a feature where users can create local tournaments and only a certain amount of teams can enter the tournament based on their overall skill level as a team and/or the tournament's format type.
