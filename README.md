I built an app that would help build a community of League of Legends players to come together to form local teams, talk about League of Legends, or anything relating to eSports or whatever they desire. Users will be able to find other local players that want to create a competitive team to play against other local teams or teams via online on the rift. 

Users will be able to create an account and will have to provide some important information such as their name, location, language, position, skill level, DOB, type of transportation, and in-game screen name. From there, users will have the ability to browse other users' information and can also create a team to play competitevely, <i>(or casually)</i>, against other local teams or online. After creating a team, the user who is managing the team can find other users and will be able to select/invite someone into their team, while users without a team will be able to browse other teams that are in need of players.

If there is time, I would like to implement a feature where users can create local tournaments and only a certain amount of teams can enter the tournament based on their overall skill level as a team and/or the tournament's format type.
